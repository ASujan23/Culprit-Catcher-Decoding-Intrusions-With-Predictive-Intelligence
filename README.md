# Culprit-Catcher-Decoding-Intrusions-With-Predictive-Intelligence
This project presents a motion detection and facial recognition security system that detects threats in real-time, reducing delays and false alarms. It quickly identifies unauthorized individuals and alerts security with images for swift action. Flexible and automated, it ensures safety across various environments efficiently.
In light of the growing concern of theft and innocent people accessing restricted areas, security is one of the most important issues today, and I think CCTV cameras are highly ineffective as they do basic surveillance and do not prevent crime. Even if a person is monitoring the footage, their response is delayed, which can result in critical losses, and this project amends this problem completely with the implementation of the YOLO algorithm motion detection and facial recognition technology to create a powerful automated security system. 
Safety can be thought of as a fundamental requirement that must be provided for in homes, work, and public places. Increasing problems like theft, invasion, and other breaches of privacy have rendered conventional security systems such as CCTVs and motion sensors ineffective. These traditional systems place a lot of reliance on human monitoring and post event evaluations. Hence, these approaches are real time effective, which is a constraint.
